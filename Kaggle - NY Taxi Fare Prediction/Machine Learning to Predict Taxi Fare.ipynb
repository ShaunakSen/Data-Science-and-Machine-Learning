The goal of this challenge is to predict the fare of a taxi trip given information about the pickup and drop off locations, the pickup date time and number of passengers travelling.\n\nIn any analytics project 80% of the time and effort is spent on data cleaning, exploratory analysis and deriving new features. In this post, we aim to clean the data, visualize the relationship between variables and also figure out new features that are better predictors of taxi fare.\n\nThe data for this problem can be found on Kaggle . For purposes of this analysis I have imported only 6M rows out of the 55M rows from the training data. The fields that are present in the data are as below:\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/607/1*N8ieR6TxVNlDBoiw70QBrQ.png)"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Hypothesis Generation\n\nThe next step to solve any analytics problems is to list down a set of hypothesis, which in our case are factors that will affect the cost of a taxi trip.\n\n\n1. Trip distance : If the distance to be traveled is more, then fare should be higher.\n2. Time of Travel : During peak traffic hours, the taxi fare may be higher.\n3. Day of Travel : Fare amount may differ on weekday and weekends\n4. Weather Conditions : If it is snowing, there may be lower availability of cabs and hence higher fares.\n5. Is it a trip to/from airport : Trips to/from airport generally have a fixed fare.\n6. Pickup or Drop-off Neighborhood : Fare may be different based on the kind of neighborhood.\n7. Availability of taxi : If a particular location has a lot of cabs available, the fares may be lower.\n\n### Data Cleaning and Exploration\n\nIn this section, we will discuss various steps used to clean the data and understand the relationship between variables and use this understanding to create better features"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### 1.
