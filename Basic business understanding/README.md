# Business learnings

## Self notes

1. Prove profitability before raising funds - this shows investors that we have a strong foundation and that our business model is working
2. Customer centric approach
3. Dominate a space and use that learning and customer base to expand to others; Flipkart became the best book retailer first before moving onto other things

## Business model:

### 1. Value Propositions

This is NOT about YOUR idea/product. Focus on:

1. What problem are you solving?
2. What are the gains you are creating?
3. Who are your customers?

Your tech stack does not matter to customers. Customers are trying to solve a **problem** or to fulfill a **need**

So if we can build a product that serves a Need, our market space is huge compared to if our product solves specific Problems

### 2. Customer Segments

Basically we are trying to identify WHO our customers are and WHY they would buy our product

- This step needs extensive research
- We have to identify based on geographic, demographic, social factors who our target customers are
    - example male
    - 20-26 yr olds
    - urban ...
- This is a hypothesis, so a good idea is not to be too focused/narrow-minded and a bit diverse in this stage

### 3. Channels

How do we actually make money from our product? What VALUE is the customer paying for?

What is the STRATEGY by which I am going to capture that value? - **Revenue model**
