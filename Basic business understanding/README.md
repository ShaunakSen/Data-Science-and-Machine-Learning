# Business learnings

## Self notes

1. Prove profitability before raising funds - this shows investors that we have a strong foundation and that our business model is working
2. Customer centric approach
3. Dominate a space and use that learning and customer base to expand to others; Flipkart became the best book retailer first before moving onto other things
4. Only 8% startups in India raise funds. But off the 92% there is a small % of startups who are **bootstrapped (rely on own savings and revenues in order to operate and expand) -** credits**:** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdY_pttRywQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdY_pttRywQ)
    1. Quite difficult to do - start off with savings/or get a paying customer soon
    2. Product/service should sell itself
    3. If u can pull this off it means u own our company 100% - no stakeholders, voting rights etc.
    4. myoperator, wingify, great learning, QuickHeal (bootsrapped until 1995-2010), Kayako, FusionCharts, kaleyra, Zerodha (an unicorn startup which is bootsrapped - 30 people tech team!), Directi, zoho (saas unicorn)
    5. A lot of these are SAAS based

## The 9 components of any business

![https://i.imgur.com/HVQm3vr.png](https://i.imgur.com/HVQm3vr.png)

### 1. Value Propositions

This is NOT about YOUR idea/product. Focus on:

1. What problem are you solving?
2. What are the gains you are creating?
3. Who are your customers?

Your tech stack does not matter to customers. Customers are trying to solve a **problem** or to fulfill a **need**

So if we can build a product that serves a Need, our market space is huge compared to if our product solves specific Problems

### 2. Customer Segments

Basically we are trying to identify WHO our customers are and WHY they would buy our product

- This step needs extensive research
- We have to identify based on geographic, demographic, social factors who our target customers are
    - example male
    - 20-26 yr olds
    - urban ...
- This is a hypothesis, so a good idea is not to be too focused/narrow-minded and a bit diverse in this stage

### 3. Channels

How will our product reach the correct customers?

- both

### 4. Customer relationships

It basically says:

1. How to GET customers
2. How to KEEP customers
3. How to GROW customers

### 5. Revenue streams

How do we actually make money from our product? What VALUE is the customer paying for?

What is the STRATEGY by which I am going to capture that value? - **Revenue model**

- simple transaction absed
- freemium model
- license/subscription model

Note, revenue model is different from pricing tactics, i.e. what is the amount I am going to charge?

This has to be figured out slowly and iteratively by incorporating feedback and interacting with our customers

- Finance
- Physical - plant/machines/vans..

What exactly are we acquiring from partners? What activities are they going to perform and when?

Sometimes startups make mistake by thinking that they need large companies as partners from Day 1. The types of partnerships you need in Year 1 differs from Year 3 and 10

Many types of partnerships

- Joint ventures
- Strategic alliances
- Regular buyers and sellers
- ...

### 8. Key activities

- Production - actually making something
- Problem solving - like consultation, engineering
- Supply Chain management

### 9. Costs

All the above 8 add up to Costs. What are the costs and expenses are reqd to operate the business model

- What are the most important costs we need
- What are the most expensive resources
- What key activities are the most expensive

## Angel Investor vs Venture Capitalists

Based on: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhLGL6iU94M

1. AI uses their own money to invest while VC uses other peoples' money
2. AI: usually entrepreneurs/ex entrepreneurs who invest their own money. VCs are usually an entity who raise money from various sources like large corporations, firms and they pool in that money to invest in startups
3. AI comes in at a very early stage (high risk). VC usually come in the growth/expansion stage (lower risk)
4. AI takes larger stake as they come earlier (ROI is higher)
5. AI do not stay involved for long period. After first investment, they sell off the stake usually. VCs usually stay longer, help the company grow by raising future investments and usually wait for IPO/acquisition to sell their stake and get ROI
6. AI because they invest a smaller amount do not interfere in the workings of the company. VCs are heavily involved. AI: non board members. VC: board members
