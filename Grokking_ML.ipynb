        "\n",
        "This portion of the interview is fairly similar to other software engineering coding interviews where the interviewer gives a coding problem, such as perform an ‘In-order tree traversal’, and the candidate is expected to solve that in about half an hour. There is ample content available on how to best prepare for such questions.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Machine learning understanding**\n",
        "\n",
        "This area generally focuses on individual understanding of basic ML concepts such as supervised vs. unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning, classification vs. regression, deep learning, optimization functions, and the learning process of various ML algorithms. There are many courses and books that go over these fundamental concepts. They facilitate the learning of ML basics and help candidates prepare for the interview.\n",

Hence, this course helps in developing the thought pattern required to approach ML system design questions.\n",

        "For instance, you may be asked to design a search engine that displays the most relevant results in response to user queries. You could narrow down the problem’s scope by asking the following questions:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Is it a general search engine like Google or Bing or a specialized search engine like Amazon’s products search?\n",
        "\n",
        "- What kind of queries is it expected to answer?\n",
        "\n",

        "> Build a generic search engine that returns relevant results for queries like \"Richard Nixon\", \"Programming languages\" etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "Or, you may be asked to build a system to display a Twitter feed for a user. In this case, you can discuss how the feed is currently displayed and how it can be improved to provide a better experience for the users.\n",
        "\n",
        "After inspecting the problem from all aspects, you can easily narrow it down to a precise machine learning problem statement as follows:\n",

        "**Understanding scale and latency requirements**\n",
        "\n",
        "Another very important part of the problem setup is the discussion about performance and capacity considerations of the system. This conversation will allow you to clearly understand the scale of the system and its requirements.\n",

        "If you were given the search engine problem, you would ask:\n",

        "    Do we want to return the search result in 100 milliseconds or 500 milliseconds?\n",
        "\n",
        "Similarly, if you were given the Twitter feed problem, you would ask:\n",

        "\n",

        "\n",

        "    If a query has 10 billion matching documents, how many of these would be ranked by our model?\n",

        "The answers to these questions will guide you when you come up with the architecture of the system. **Knowing that you need to return results quickly will influence the depth and complexity of your models.

        "\n",
        "You will use offline metrics to quickly test the models’ performance during the development phase. You may have generic metrics; for example, if you are performing binary classification, you will use AUC, log loss, precision, recall, and F1-score. In other cases, you might have to come up with specific metrics for a certain problem. For instance, for the search ranking problem, you would use __NDCG__ as a metric.\n",
