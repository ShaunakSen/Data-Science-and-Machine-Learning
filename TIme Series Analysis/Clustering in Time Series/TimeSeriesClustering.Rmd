## Clustering Time Series Data

Here we are going to use the package `TSclust`

### Grabbing Some Data

Since stock ticker data are not too dissimilar to the data that I am currently working with, they seemed like a reasonable target for my experiments.

```{r}
library(quantmod)
symbols <- c('A', 'AAPL', 'ADBE', 'AMD', 'AMZN', 'BA', 'CL', 'CSCO', 'EXPE', 'FB',
  'GOOGL', 'GRMN', 'IBM', 'INTC', 'LMT', 'MSFT', 'NFLX', 'ORCL', 'RHT', 'YHOO')

print (symbols)
```
```{r}
start = as.Date("2014-01-01")
until = as.Date("2014-12-31")
```

```{r}
stocks = lapply(symbols, function(symbol) {
adjusted = getSymbols(symbol, from = start, to = until, auto.assign = FALSE)[, 6]
names(adjusted) = symbol
adjusted
})
```
