        "Our goal here is more to make the main guideline as clear as possible than to obstruct the reader comprehension with some technical details (that can be, nevertheless, very interesting). Especially, we will go from simple problems to more difficult ones in order to show, along the way, how neural networks naturally (at least in the spirit) extend some well known techniques. Obviously, on our way, we will have to make some simplifications or to omit some details. We apologise in advance if it can be, at some points, frustrating for the more advanced readers.\n",

        "Arthur Samuel, pioneer in the field of computer gaming and artificial intelligence, defined Machine Learning (ML) as the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. In other words, whatever the purpose of our algorithm is, the rules to achieve this goal are not explicitly programmed but are “learned” (and we will come back to this word later) by the computer, based on some useful data. This is the big difference with a classical algorithm.\n",
        "In a classical algorithm, rules are explicitly given to the computer to perform a task. In a machine learning algorithm, a model (parametrized or not) that define a family of possible rules is given to the computer along with a whole bunch of data and a strategy to find the better rules among the possible ones based on these data (optimisation). In the next paragraph we will explicit all these elements in one of the most basic machine learning models that exist: the linear regression.\n",
