Lower is better: a smaller validation set error generally means better test set performance, and a smaller number of trials means less time invested. Clearly, there are significant advantages to Bayesian methods, and these graphs, along with other impressive results, convinced me it was time to take the next step and learn model-based hyperparameter optimization.\n",

        "The aim of hyperparameter optimization in machine learning is to find the hyperparameters of a given machine learning algorithm that return the best performance as measured on a validation set. (Hyperparameters, in contrast to model parameters, are set by the machine learning engineer before training. The number of trees in a random forest is a hyperparameter while the weights in a neural network are model parameters learned during training. I like to think of hyperparameters as the model settings to be tuned.)\n",

        "Here f(x) represents an objective score to minimize— such as RMSE or error rate— evaluated on the validation set; x* is the set of hyperparameters that yields the lowest value of the score, and x can take on any value in the domain X. **In simple terms, we want to find the model hyperparameters that yield the best score on the validation set metric.**\n",
        "\n",
        "The problem with hyperparameter optimization is that evaluating the objective function to find the score is extremely expensive. Each time we try different hyperparameters, we have to train a model on the training data, make predictions on the validation data, and then calculate the validation metric. With a large number of hyperparameters and complex models such as ensembles or deep neural networks that can take days to train, this process quickly becomes intractable to do by hand!\n",
        "\n",
        "Grid search and random search are slightly better than manual tuning because we set up a grid of model hyperparameters and run the train-predict -evaluate cycle automatically in a loop while we do more productive things (like feature engineering). However, even these methods are relatively inefficient because they do not choose the next hyperparameters to evaluate based on previous results. **Grid and random search are completely uninformed by past evaluations, and as a result, often spend a significant amount of time evaluating “bad” hyperparameters.**\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, if we have the following graph with a lower score being better, where does it make sense to concentrate our search? If you said below 200 estimators, then you already have the idea of Bayesian optimization! We want to focus on the most promising hyperparameters, and if we have a record of evaluations, then it makes sense to use this information for our next choice.\n",
