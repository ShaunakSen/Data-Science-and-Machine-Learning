(Hyperparameters, in contrast to model parameters, are set by the machine learning engineer before training. The number of trees in a random forest is a hyperparameter while the weights in a neural network are model parameters learned during training. I like to think of hyperparameters as the model settings to be tuned.)\n",

Each time we try different hyperparameters, we have to train a model on the training data, make predictions on the validation data, and then calculate the validation metric. With a large number of hyperparameters and complex models such as ensembles or deep neural networks that can take days to train, this process quickly becomes intractable to do by hand!\n",
